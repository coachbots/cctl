**cctl** documentation
================================

Welcome to **cctl**'s documentation. **cctl** is a system for interfacing with
and controlling Coachbots at Northwestern University.

You are reading the documentation for version `2.0` of **cctl**, meaning that
the documentation you're reding is a major rewrite of what **cctl** (and to
that extent **coach-os** were). I would urge you to take a deep dive into this
documentation as things have significantly changed since the documentation was
last updated.
